Welcome to my experimental website created with [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html).  I am having a hard time deciding whether I want to use [jeckyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for my web page and have a blog or just stick with straight [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html).  Right now, I am leaning toward using straight [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html).

My research and teaching interests include computational statistics and reproducible research.
